# FZFCPP
---

## What this is

This is a ground up re-do of the popular CLI tool [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) written in C++

## Why this?

I just wanted a slightly faster FZF since doing larger directory takes some time to load, (however that could be windows filesystem being slow)

## Platforms

For now I'll be focusing on getting it done on windows, with a slight possiblity on Linux
